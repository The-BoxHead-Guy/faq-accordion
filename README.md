### What I learned

At simple sight, the greatest thing I learned with the development of this project was indeed the handling of **click** and **keyboard** events and produce a change in the FAQ's component

In addition, the creation, setting and development of the visual details that surely enhances the UX of the website was also something that I can relate of target as something **useful** to understand

##### event.target

If it weren't by that built-in *read-only* function, this couldn't be possible or I couldn't be able to make a straightforward solution.

##### Setting a neat, clean and wonderful transition changes

I think that was the most fun part, apart of making all the logic and function of the project.

### Continued development

There's a feature that can be implemented to this project which is in the `/possible-features.md` file of this project, check it out if you want to learn more about it.

I will be looking forward to keep making these kind of projects where the handling of events could make a change on the website, providing a great deal of interactivity between the user and the client.

### Useful resources

Almost all of the resources that I could learn and apply solutions from were from:

[MDN mozilla developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
[W3school - javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

There were so much things to learn from those places, and the strawberry above the cake was that it wasn't used chatGPT but in this case: **codeium** as my copilot during the process of this project as it allowed me to make my code cleaner and set new ideas that were indeed required to find a proper solution to this challenge.
